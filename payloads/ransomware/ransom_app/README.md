Simple application made with python and tkinter to demonstrate how an application can encrypt and decrypt your files with extensions {'.txt', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'}. Right now the application decrypts all {'.txt', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'} files when user gives up the right password (lihapulla). 

Run the script inside a safe folder with no important files (incase something goes wrong) to launch the program and enjoy
```
$ ./encrypt.py
```
