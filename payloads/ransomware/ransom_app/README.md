Version 1.0

Simple application made with python and tkinter to demonstrate how an application can encrypt and decrypt your files. Right now the application decrypts all the contents when user gives up the right password (lihapulla). 

Run the script inside a safe folder with no important files (incase something goes wrong) to launch the program and enjoy
```
$ ./encrypt.py
```
