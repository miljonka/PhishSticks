# Week 38 (First week of reports)
We started the week on 19.9.2023 with a meeting with [Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com), the teacher responsible for guiding us through this project. There was a lot to unpack considering actual workloads. There is a lot of moving parts in the project, so it's good to get a sense of tangible goals for the project. Some things discussed in the meeting (not in order):

### Project management
 - Initialize GitHub and get everyone in the project on it (done, you are reading this on GitHub)
 - Start reporting work on GitHub (done-ish, everyone is getting their workflow up and running)
 - Update the timetable for the project
 - Update the project plan
 - Finalize worksheet & kanban-board for easier time management
 - Project group emphasized flexible work hours, Tero asked for a more concise schedule

### Get the list of required hardware finalized
 - DigiSparks are on the way, expecting to get them this week
 - Discuss additional components and ordering them 
  - Actual casings for the device(s)?
  - Female USB port for passthrough? We still need to research passthrough capabilities on the DigiSpark

### Payloads

#### Keylogger
 - Research passthrough capabilities of the DigiSpark
 - Research actual method of how keyloggers work
 - Research possibilities of LoRa for sending data

#### Ransomware
 - Write up a ethics & security warning to consider the actual implications of the possible harm done by the payload
 - Consider using very specific files as targets for encryption (use a complex file extension: i.e. *.testransomwarepayload)

#### Reverse shell
 - Antti demonstrated the barebones version we created on earlier weeks during planning for the project
 - Create a video demonstrating that version to showcase it on the fly (done: see [Antti's notes](https://github.com/therealhalonen/PhishSticks/blob/master/notes/halonen/notes.md) and [video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v6djrHg2qI))
 - Research possibilities

### Other stuff
 -  Make a list of earlier work done on the subject to use as source material
