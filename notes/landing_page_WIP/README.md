## About

Welcome to our project! We are a group of three students who share a passion for cyber security.   
This project is a part of the [Infrastructure Project 2023](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/infra-project-2023/) course led by our instructor, Tero Karvinen.    
In our journey to explore and enhance our skills, we have collaborated on a unique project â€“ a Simulated BadUSB dropper/sideloader. This project is designed with three distinct payloads, showcasing the diverse ways in which BadUSB attacks can be employed.

### Project Highlights:

- **BadUSB Simulation:** Our project emulates the behavior of a BadUSB device, demonstrating potential security risks associated with USB attacks.

- **Diverse Payloads:** We have crafted [three different payloads](/payloads/), each highlighting the versatility and potential impact of BadUSB attacks. These payloads serve as educational tools, helping users understand the intricacies of such threats.

- **Working with [Digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1):** Digispark is a microcontroller development board that functions similiarly to Arduino, but is much smaller. Using this board gave us the capability to act as a HID keyboard, as well as provided some stealthiness due to its size. It can be hidden in a USB stick (or other devices)! Our documentation on Digispark can be found [HERE](/digispark/)!

### Our Process:

The entire development and testing process took place in a controlled and safe computer lab environment. As future cyber security professionals, we prioritize responsible and ethical exploration of security-related concepts. Our objective is to contribute to the cyber security community by providing insights into the risks associated with USB-based attacks.

Feel free to explore the various sections of this repository to learn more about our project, access the [final report](/documentation/final_report.md), explore [mitigations](/documentation/Mitigations.md), and get to know the [individuals behind this endeavor](#contact).

Thank you for your interest in our work!
