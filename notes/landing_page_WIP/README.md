## About

Welcome to our project! We are a group of three students who share a passion for cyber security.   
This project is a part of the [Infrastructure Project 2023](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/infra-project-2023/) course led by our instructor, Tero Karvinen.    
In our journey to explore and enhance our skills, we have collaborated on a unique project â€“ a Simulated BadUSB dropper/sideloader. This project is designed with three distinct payloads, showcasing the diverse ways in which BadUSB attacks can be employed.

### Project Highlights:

- **BadUSB Simulation:** Our project emulates the behavior of a BadUSB device, demonstrating potential security risks associated with USB attacks.

- **Diverse Payloads:** We have crafted three different payloads, each highlighting the versatility and potential impact of BadUSB attacks. These payloads serve as educational tools, helping users understand the intricacies of such threats.

### Our Process:

The entire development and testing process took place in a controlled and safe computer lab environment. As future cyber security professionals, we prioritize responsible and ethical exploration of security-related concepts. Our objective is to contribute to the cyber security community by providing insights into the risks associated with USB-based attacks.

Feel free to explore the various sections of this repository to learn more about our project, access the final report, explore mitigation's, and get to know the individuals behind this endeavor.

Thank you for your interest in our work!
