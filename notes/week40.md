# Week 40

Once again we started the week on a tuesday. 3.10.2023 to be precise, and once again we had a meeting with Tero. The topics discussed included:

  * Make a unified "about"-text for the YouTube videos (still wip)
  * Make a local copy of DigiStump
  * Study possibilities for LoRa and ESP32 (this idea is scrapped for now due to possible scope creep)
  * Add more photos to the front page! (Done, and will be under monitoring)

## TO-DO - new & old

 * Work on the different payloads
 * Fine-tune the reporting standards
 * Make a decision on LoRa or other possibilities for moving data from the keylogger to a remote location
 * Work on changing the PID/VID on the Digispark (make detecting the device harder)
 * Passthrough capabilities of the Digispark?
