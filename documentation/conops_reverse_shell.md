# Reverse shell
A reverse shell is technique that involves the establishment of a network connection, allowing the attacker to gain access and control, between an attacker-controlled system and a target system.
Shell session vs Reverse Shell:
- In a typical shell session, a user connects to a remote system to execute commands.
- In a reverse shell scenario, the connection is reversed, with the compromised target system initiating the connection back to the attacker's system.

Reverse shells are favored by attackers for their stealthy nature. Since the connection is initiated from the inside, it can be challenging for security tools to detect or block these connections, making them an attractive option for malicious actors.

### X & Cyber Kill Chain
- The thing as a part of Cyber kill chain
	- Which part of Cyber Kill Chain is it used?

### How does it work
- Technically

### Potential use cases
- Where it's used? What it is used FOR? IN OUR PROJECT!

### Limitations and restrictions 
(### Vastuut (tätä on kyl alleviivattu joka kohassa et lakia ei saa rikkoa)) 
- What its not.

### Lifecycle
- From beginning to possible removing or disconnecting etc.
	- For malware: When it ends?
	- For USB device: When plugged out or "what happens to usb stick"

### Mitigation 
- How to defend against.
