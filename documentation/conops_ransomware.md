# Ransomware
Ransomware is a malware that begins by infecting devices or networks via malicious links, email attachments, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once infected, it encrypts files by using cryptography, making files unreadable without a decryption key. A ransom note/popup window appears, demanding a payment for the key.  If the victim pays, they expect to get a decryption key to decrypt and get the files back. However, paying doesn't guarantee file recovery or prevent future attacks.
