## Project final report

### 1. Project description

#### Project goal

The goal of the project is to demonstrate a physical attack method and various forms of attacks using inconspicuous USB devices.

#### Project Objective and Results

The main goal of the project is a device or a collection of devices that showcase attack tools. Within the time constraints, the device is developed to operate without user actions. Additionally, the device(s) are initially designed to function independently, but the intention is to enhance their capabilities to operate over the network. 

The device should also be relatively inconspicuous and operate both independently in a USB port. Software components will be released (e.g., on GitHub), and documentation of development stages and results will be recorded in a Teams group created internally.

#### Presentation of Project Component Results

As part of the project, various attack methods are constructed. Concrete results arising from these methods are examined on a case-by-case basis, such as:

  * Keylogger: The device records user keystrokes and saves them to itself or the victim's machine. In the best case ("reach goal"), the data can be transferred (wirelessly) to the attacker's device. Data transfer can be developed to work over WiFi or by exploring the use of LoRa radio signal transmissions.
  * Ransomware: The device makes a visible change to the computer (e.g., encrypts files or plays music) until the user enters a password in the prompt that appears, reversing the actions of the attack.
  * Reverse shell: The device establishes a connection to the desired machine. Results can be presented, for example, by having the attacking machine perform actions on the target via the command line. In further development, focus is placed on the functionality of the reverse shell on a Windows 10 machine with default factory settings.

In addition to these, results are presented in the final presentation with a demonstration of the device's operation. Progress towards learning objectives is monitored through reports on GitHub, and reflections on results and learning are made in the final demo.

#### Learning Objectives
The learning objectives of the project include examining the physical side of penetration testing devices. Additionally, expertise in conducting network attacks on devices initially compromised by physical attacks is deepened. The goal is also to learn concrete code behind attacks that are conducted against realistic targets. As a hypothetical example being able to bypass Windows Defender is a realistic goal that this project aims to reach. This helps to understand the functioning of attacks and potentially how to defend against them.
