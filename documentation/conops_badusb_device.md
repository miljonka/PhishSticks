# BadUSB Device

A BadUSB device is a device designed to perform a cybersecurity attack delivered via USB. Usually it operates by disguising itself as a keyboard (or other Human Interface Device/HID) and injects malicious code into the victim host. This can include downloading malware that enables the attacker to manipulate the victim computer further.

Physical devices may bypass some cybersecurity measures, since in some cases deterring web attacks may be easier than defending against prompts given by a user (or in this case, the BadUSB device).

### BadUSB & Cyber Kill Chain
When considering BadUSB through the lens of the [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), it lands somewhere throughout the following stages:

  1.~~ Reconnaissance ~~ BadUSB does not get involved in the reconnaissance stage of the Cyber Kill Chain (other than when planning for stage 2 - Weaponization).
  2. Weaponization - A BadUSB device can be considered as an attack tool when you know that you can deliver your payloads physically. Physical access to the target is required. Also, BadUSB is always combined with a suitable payload that it delivers.
  3. Delivery - This on is pretty self-explanatory. A BadUSB device is a tool designed for delivering a payload.
  4. Exploitation - BadUSB exploits work on systems that have possibly overlooked the possibility of a physical attack on the system. The vulnerability itself is an unguarded USB-port. Other vulnerabilities exploited 
  5. Installation
  6. Command & Control
  7. Actions on objectives

### How does it work
- Technically

### Potential use cases
- Where it's used? What it is used FOR? IN OUR PROJECT!

### Limitations and restrictions 
(### Vastuut (tätä on kyl alleviivattu joka kohassa et lakia ei saa rikkoa)) 
- What its not.

### Lifecycle
- From beginning to possible removing or disconnecting etc.
	- For malware: When it ends?
	- For USB device: When plugged out or "what happens to usb stick"

### Mitigation 
- How to defend against.
