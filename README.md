# PhishSticks
PhishSticks is a project made for [the Infra Project 2023 course](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/infra-project-2023/).

The goal of the project is to create a tool for ethical pentesting by making a simulated attack using a malicious USB device. The different types of malware include a keylogger, ransomware and reverse shell. [therealhalonen](https://github.com/therealhalonen/) [made a demo](https://github.com/therealhalonen/PhishSticks/tree/master/payloads/revshell_demo) that showcases a simple reverse shell that phones home (and bypasses Windows Defender with default settings!).

The project will be finalized by 12.12.2023. All work noted here before the date is to be considered WIP.

## Always consider the local laws and ethical ramifications when doing pentesting!
